%  ARDrone Wi-Fi Control: Waypoint Tracking
%  ========================================================================
%
%  This script initializes a Simulink model that enables control of the
%  Parrot ARDrone via Wi-Fi using Simulink. The guidance and control laws 
%  track  desired target positions given in a list of waypoints. 
%
%  IMPORTANT NOTE: The position estimation given in this example is inaccurate and
%  may lead to unexpected behavior of the vehicle.  The position is estimated
%  by intergating a velocity estimation, which in turn is inaccurate.
%  The velocity is estimated by the Drone onboard flight computer. The
%  velocity estimation can be improved if there are features on the floor
%  as the Drone runs an optical flow algorithm for velocity determination.
%  
%  
%  Requirements:
%       Matlab, Simulink, Real-Time-Wndows-Target
